/**
 * One end-to-end session: a fresh workspace, the real binary, a WebDriver.
 *
 * `tauri-driver` bridges the WebDriver protocol to the platform's own driver
 * (`msedgedriver` on Windows, matched to the installed WebView2 runtime). It is
 * started here, told which binary to launch, and torn down with the session.
 *
 * The application data folder is never the person's own. `RIDGEBEAM_DATA_DIR` points the
 * application at a temporary directory, created empty for each session and removed afterwards
 * — so every run begins from migration 001 on a blank file, and a test that passes has proven
 * the migrations as well as the screen. The works the suite creates live in temporary folders
 * the tests make and remove themselves.
 *
 * A work is never opened from the command line in this release: the suite creates one through
 * the Start screen, in a temporary folder of its own, and reopens it from the recent list.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   RIDGEBEAM_E2E_APP         path to the debug binary (default: src-tauri/target/debug/ridgebeam.exe)
 *   RIDGEBEAM_E2E_EDGEDRIVER  path to msedgedriver.exe (default: `msedgedriver` on PATH)
 *   RIDGEBEAM_E2E_KEEP        set to keep the temporary workspace for inspection
 *   RIDGEBEAM_E2E_VERBOSE     set to print the driver's output
